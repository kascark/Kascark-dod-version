HUN15.T;The Death of Gabor I;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN15.D;The King of Hungary and once Duke of Nitra has died. He was most well known for his assistance in the liberation of Hungary from the Ottoman Empire which many commentators had originally considered a impossibility due to the relative stability of the Ottoman Empire until 1789. As a direct result of this, he was crowned the King of Hungary much to the annoyance of Bohemia who have continued to refuse to relinquish the Crown of San Stefen and left all attempts to recover it in failure. Gabor I was not a ambitious man and never had any children or close relatives to speak of, the Duchy of Nitria after all was not a prestigious title. This has caused succession issues that will have to be solved with a Regency Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

HUN17.T;Springtime in Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN17.D;The Hungarian regency council has been unable to select a replacement king after the death of Gabor I and have practically resorted to bickering between each other for little or no reason. The liberal revolutions that have spread throughout Europe have taken a interest in this predicament and have promptly declared the Kingdom of Hungary effectively dead as they have committed to a coup d'etat that has taken out both the regency council and the entire "reactionary" government with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HUN18.T;A Alternative Option;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN18.D;Rather then search for a hard-to-find survivor of a long-dead Hungarian dynasty or risk further falling into Bohemian influence by crowning a member of the Jagellion Dynasty, we could crown the Duke of Austria as the King of Hungary and create a union between us and them. Its a controversial option and has a lot of opposition but the potential of effectively taking over German territory via a personal union is extremely tempting. Of course, we could just crown a member of the Jagellions or continue searching for a Hungarian heir but this is a option that would guarantee a quick heir rather then being forced to wait for the regency council to come up with a valid Hungarian heir or fall into the Bohemian Sphere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN19.D;A envoy from the Kingdom of Hungary has unexpectedly offered the crown of Hungary to the Duke of Austria. This would effectively mean that as he is both the ruler of Hungary and Austria, we would form a union between both countries. The Hapsburg Dynasty has been looking for a greater title then that of the elective monarchy of the Commonwealth or the Duchy of Austria and the chance has finally arrived. A chance for the Dynasty to finally advance beyond its mediocre station as the Duke of Austria and into greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN21.D;The succession crisis that has plagued Hungary since the death of Gabor I has finally come to a end in a way that nobody could have ever hoped to expect beforehand: The Duke of Austria has been crowned in $CAPITAL$ as both the King of Hungary and the Duke of Austria, creating a union between both Hungary and Austria and effectively merging the two nations into one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN22.T;News from Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN22.D;Hungary has been consulting with the Duke of Austria with the intent to form a "Union" between both nations. As Austria is a member state of the Holy Roman Empire and the Hungarians still own the Duchy of Nitria, it is our duty to respond in a manner which suits the prestige of our title as the Emperor and prime imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.A;Allow them. This could weaken the Revolutionaries in the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.B;The Duke of Austria must use the title: "King in Hungary".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.C;Hungary must relinquish the Duchy of Nitria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.D;Denied. Force them to relinquish Nitria if they ignore us..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN23.T;Interjection from Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN23.D;Bohemia has sent us a envoy stating that we must use the title: "King in Hungary" and kneel before the Holy Roman Emperor at his palace in Prague. This would be extremely humiliating internationally and it is likely that we may even be thrown out of the world stage if we did so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.A;Kneel and take the title of "King in Hungary";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.B;Go to hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.C;This is too hard. Find someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN24.D;Bohemia has sent us a envoy stating that we must give up the Duchy of Nitria if we wish to continue down this path. This was to be expected as Bohemia has been wanting that title returned to them ever since the Hungarian Revolution ended in the Duke of Nitria (who was a vassal of Bohemia) being crowned as the King of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265424.A;Return Nitria to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265424.B;Burn in hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265424.C;This is too hard. Find someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN27.T;The Issue of Hungary-Austria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN27.D;Either though revolution or congress we have formed the Danubian Confederation. However we have been unable to fully unite all Danubian territories under our banner due to the existence of the Kingdom of Hungary-Austria, a blight on Europe. Many within Austria agree with the sentiment that Hungary-Austria was a mistake and are ready to take up arms against their government with our direct support. However, doing so risks retaliation by Hungary-Austria and since it is likely that other states in Europe are already preparing to go to war with us: adding Hungary-Austria to this mess could be very dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265428.A;Tell them that it is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265428.B;Tell them that it is time to unite with their German brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN28.T;The Austrian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN28.D;Vienna has fallen to a large group of Danubian nationalists intending to unify Austria with the newly formed Danubian Confederation. Unfortunately, before a counter-attack was possible many other cities and towns also fell which lead to our immediate withdrawal from Austria Proper. These events are likely the result of direct support by the Danubian Confederation to destroy our nation for the sake of German nationalism. If Hungary-Austria does not act decisively and declare war on these rogue Austrians, it is likely that the Union of Hungary-Austria will collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265429.A;Declare War. NOW.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265429.B;Give Up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN29.T;The Hungarian Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN29.D;The Hungarian Regency Council had been created to choose a new king for the Kingdom of Hungary and it is clear that they had attempted to impose a Jagellion onto us. However, the fact that the Regency Council had attempted to crown a Jagellion was not lost on the military and there would not even be an announcement before the military marched right into the palace and wrested control of the government from the council. The Hungarian military does not tolerate fools who attempt to pull Hungary further into the sphere of Bohemia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265430.A;The Junta will protect us from the Bohemian Beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN30.T;Danubian Confederation Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN30.D;As we have been unable to recover Austria from the Danubian Confederation, it is practically inevitable that the collapse of this union will occur. Already there are many individuals questioning the continuation of this union in $CAPITAL$ and the government has already stated that it will be voting on the future of the union in the coming days. It is likely that they will vote Hungary-Austria out of existence since there is nobody left from Austria to continue support of this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC31516;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'.

EVTNAME44101;The Zhou Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44101;The Zhou Dynasty was a result of a compromise between a Millenarian Figure known as Li Xiuquing and the various warlords and ancient dynasties scattered around the south of China. Li Xiuquing had failed in his ultimate ambition to create a Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace but had at least completely dislodged the Southern Ming dynasty from the region, the failure only coming as the remaining warlords and dynasties formed a coalition to stop the Taiping Rebellion from completely taking over the south of China. As the individuals following the Taiping religion were ultimately limited and the chances of his survival was too small, Li Xiuquing was forced to the table and forced to appoint and recognize a new dynasty in the region. The name of this dynasty would come from the strongest warlord in the region whom claimed to be of decent from a rebellious general from the previous century, Wu Sangui. This claim would ultimately be flimsy at best but he was only a means to a end for Li Xiuquing and thus the Zhou Dynasty was born.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME44187;The Taiping Anniversary;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44187;A hundred and ten years ago upon this day, the Taiping Rebellion had started. This rebellion had completely failed to created a Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace as it lacked any considerable leadership but had at least toppled the warlords in the region and forced the Southern Ming to acknowledge that they had no claim over it any more. The empire that had been created from the many compromises and deals made with the Confucian majority would be known as the Zhou Dynasty, a dynasty that was forced to acknowledge Confucian teachings but at the same time teachings of the Taiping religion. This anniversary is remarkable because the most important promise made to the Taiping leadership would be that we must embark upon a final conquest of China before this date or run the risk of another rebellion. We have grown strong in the many years since the rebellion and it seems that this would be the perfect time to launch a final conquest of china.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, one of the promises made would be that the Zhou Empire would embark on a great conquest of the rest of China before one hundred and ten years are up. It appears that the chances that the Zhou Empire will invade the rest of China are now total regardless of whomever is currently in control of the empire.

As such, it became a model for later Chinese armies. \n\n The Ever Victorious Army numbered around 5,000 soldiers at its height. It often defeated rebel forces which were numerically much larger because it was better armed, better commanded, and better trained.
