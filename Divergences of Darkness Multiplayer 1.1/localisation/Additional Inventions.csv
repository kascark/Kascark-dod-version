haber_bosch_process;Haber–Bosch Process;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
haber_bosch_process_desc;The Haber–Bosch process, is an artificial nitrogen fixation process and is the main industrial procedure for the production of ammonia today. The process converts atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) by a reaction with hydrogen (H2) using a metal catalyst under high temperatures and pressures.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

minie_ball;Minié Ball;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
minie_ball_desc;The Minié ball is a conical-shaped bullet made of iron and soft lead. It was developed in 1849 by French army captain Claude-Etienne Minié based on the work of Henri-Gustave Delvigne. The Minié bullet solved the problem of designing ammunition for the new muzzle-loaded rifles. The bullet expanded to fit the tight rifling grooves when fired, allowing for a greater muzzle velocity and range of accuracy. The greater speed and weight of the Minié ball meant wounds were more severe and required more amputations as the bullets would tear straight through and shatter muscles, tendons, and bones;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
barbed_wire;Barbed Wire;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
barbed_wire_desc;Barbed Wire was a late-nineteenth century American invention, used originally to keep herds of cattle fenced in. Barbed Wire became integrated with the trench systems of World War One as it was relatively easy to string up and often survived artillery bombardments and machine gun fire. The sharp barbs caused injury to attacking infantry. Emplacing rows of barbed wire in front of the trench line gave the machine gunners and field batteries time to decimate an attack while it was stuck cutting the wire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
concrete_pillboxes;Concrete Pillboxes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
concrete_pillboxes_desc;These were strongpoints along trench systems often dug into the ground, and serving as a protected emplacement for defending machine guns, riflemen and/or light artillery. The reinforced structure provided protection from grenades and mortar shells as well as the weather.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
quick_firing_field_guns;Quick-Firing Field Guns;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
quick_firing_field_guns_desc;Quick-Firing Field Guns are breech-loaded artillery pieces that combine several characteristics to produce a high rate of fire. Buffer mechanisms and self-contained ammunition limited and then eliminated recoil of the barrel. Innovations in breech technology allowed for rapid reloading of the gun. One of an interrupted-screw or sliding-block system sealed the breech to conserve firing velocity. One of the most successful quick-firing designs was the French 'Canon de 75 modèle 1897.' This 75mm piece could fire fifteen rounds per minute of high-explosive and shrapnel, devastating attacking infantry. Other nations quickly copied the technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
indirect_fire_techniques;Indirect Fire Techniques;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
indirect_fire_techniques_desc;Indirect fire involves aiming and firing artillery projectiles on targets not in a direct line of sight. The degree of accuracy achieved is dependent on calculations of the azimuth (an angular measurement of the target point relative to the reference point) and firing elevation of the gun.  The first practical manual was written in 1882 by a Russian officer, KG Guk. Guk described how to fix aiming points for firing arcs using geometry. The lack of a device to measure azimuth was solved in 1890 when Germany introduced the lining-plane. The lining-plane was mounted in-line with the bore and enabled the measurement of large angles. The effectiveness of indirect fire increased greatly with actual battlefield experience in the First World War. The introduction of airborne spotters in balloons and aircraft allowed for gun crews to correct their firing calculations during battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

penicillin_desc;Antibiotics derived from Penicillium fungi, they became significant because they were the first drugs effective against many serious diseases such as syphilis and staphylococcus infections.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
florence_nightingale;Florence Nightingale;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
florence_nightingale_desc;Florence Nightingale was a celebrated English nurse, writer and statistician. A Christian universalist, Nightingale believed that God had called her to be a nurse. She came to prominence for her pioneering work in nursing during the Crimean War, where she tended to wounded soldiers. She was dubbed 'The Lady with the Lamp' after her habit of making rounds at night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
military_psychology;Military Psychology;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
military_psychology_desc;Military psychology is the research, design and application of psychological theories and experimentation data towards understanding, predicting and countering behaviours either in friendly or enemy forces or civilian populations that may be undesirable, threatening or potentially dangerous to the conduct of military operations. Military psychology is applied towards counseling and treatment of stress and fatigue of military personnel or military families as well as treatment of psychological trauma suffered as a result of military operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
