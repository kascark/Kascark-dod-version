abolish_slavery_title;Abolish Slavery;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abolish_slavery_desc;Slavery is legal in our nation, but no slaves are found in our fields. With slavery becoming rarer and rarer in the world, the more liberal and abolitionist sectors of our society could gain enough power to pass a bill in the UH, arguing that "abolishing this outdated institution from our country will elevate our us in the eyes of the civilized nations". With a little push from the $MONARCHTITLE$, this new bill can become a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

start_propaganda_desc;“He who wants to persuade should put his trust not in the right argument, but in the right word. The power of sound has always been greater than the power of sense.”\nA meeting in $CAPITAL$ with senior figures of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government proposed a propaganda effort to boost popular support to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government's efforts. We can choose to boost our war efforts or strengthen the government. There are no guaranteed results, however, as our marketing might fail and even backfire. Unless, of course, the press is controlled by the state...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

regency_government_desc;Sickness, foreign trips, premature death or abdication - a number of reasons can trigger a regency. The fact is that our country is currently in one, the regents aren't very good at their jobs and our country is on the edge of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
dissolve_the_upper_house_title;Dissolve the Upper House;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dissolve_the_upper_house_desc;Supreme executive power in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state emanates from $CAPITAL$, through the figure of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch. The absolute monarch is the final authority in all matters of the state, but the bureaucracy and the military are the pillars that sustain the absolutist government. In addition, the landed aristocracy, which often acts as the bureaucracy, expects and receives positions of power in the government, positions appointed by the monarch. This is necessary for the normal function of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state - the aristocrats are the governor generals, the privy-councillors, the high-ranking bureaucrats, the ministers, the judges and the executors of the monarch's decisions. For these functions, several government institutions exist and are populated by the landed nobility - the Committee of Ministers of $COUNTRY$, the Governing Senate, the State Council. They help draft and apply laws, manage foreign and internal policy, plan wars and administer the military, advise the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch as well as judge and administer justice. The monarch still can and has the final say in all these matters, and is his royal prerogative to do away the currently appointed aristocrats and pick new ones. By taking this step - effectively dissolving the upper house and appointing new ministers - the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch can surround himself with sycophants and petty nobility that are willing to do whatever he wants them to do - for a time, at least. This break in the unspoken agreement between the monarch and the bureaucrats, the monarch and the aristocracy, will bring consequences - besides exposing internal fractures in the government to the international community, it is sure to anger the nobles and sow confusion throughout the government ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME11000;Regency;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC11000;Sometimes the monarch just isn't there. Dying without a suitable or old enough heir, becoming incapable or senile while the government enters a deadlock. Sometimes the monarch is so ill that the government doesn't work and sometimes he's just away and someone incompetent was left to take care of things in his stead. Regardless of the reason, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is currently going through a regency. We can expect some instability in the years ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It is for a high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial."\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ delivered an impassionate speech today in $CAPITAL$, just the start of a campaign to gather support among the population and the government for their goal of...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME11001;The Dissolution of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Upper House;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC11001;Ministers and bureaucrats arrived in $CAPITAL$ today to find a royal decree at the government's doors: the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch has dissolved the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Upper House, effective immediately, and a new one is to be handpicked by the monarch. The news sent shockwaves through the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nobility - used to the occasional replacements, but not to such an earthshattering and drastic extent. Dissatisfaction is rampant, with many speculating (behind closed doors) that the monarch is setting up minor nobles, mostly sycophants and toadies, to execute the whims of the crown. A few of the old servants of the crown in the nobility kept their positions in order to train and guide the newcomers, but there's already evidence of lasting disruption in the state's affairs. The new upper house is set to have a majority of...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
